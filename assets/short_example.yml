# This is a YAML file, so all content must be configured per YAML specification.

# This short_example.yml file will generate 540 images in total. On a decent graphics card (eg RTX 30xx) with SD 1.5, expect 10-20 minutes to run.

# This key is required configuration of the grid itself.
grid:
    # Give a page title
    title: My Short Example Grid
    # Label the authorship, eg 'Created by mcmonkey for public educational usage'
    # This will be displayed on the bottom of the page.
    author: Created by YOUR NAME HERE for SOME REASON HERE
    # Give a page description
    # Descriptions are HTML, so you can use HTML, or to write raw symbols, use escape codes:  &lt; for <    &gt; for >    &amp; for &    &#58; for :
    description: >
                 This is to demonstrate the concept of how the infinite-axis grid system works.
                 This description here demonstrates multi-line YAML strings.

    # Optionally specify base parameters. If not set, it will use whatever parameters you have in the WebUI.
    # These can be overridden by an axis.
    params:
        steps: 20
        Sampler: euler
        seed: 1
        # You can specify custom width/height to rescale images to as parameters.

        OutWidth: 256
        OutHeight: 256
    # Can specify the format as either 'jpg' or 'png'
    # jpg makes smaller file sizes, with slightly lower quality
    # png makes bigger file sizes, at better quality
    format: jpg

# "axes" is the root key of the list of axes
axes:
    # Key names are used to organize the file, both here in YAML and in the output format.
    # So, use either very simple names, or numbers.
